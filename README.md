# Rasmus Thorsøe

Software engineer with a background in systems development and a strong focus on rendering and graphics programming.

I’m interested in rendering architecture and performance, and in understanding the impact of low-level systems on the final render.

## Projects

**cpp-opengl-rendering**  
A C++ OpenGL renderer with reusable buffer and shader abstractions, camera transforms, and runtime debug views (normals, depth, lighting). Focused on structure and observability rather than feature breadth.

**rust-wgpu-rendering**  
An earlier renderer experiment using Rust and wgpu, exploring explicit command encoding and GPU resource ownership models inspired by Vulkan-style APIs.

**P2P Uno – Anti-Cheat**  
A peer-to-peer terminal-based Uno implementation with a protocol designed to detect rule violations without a trusted authority. Built to explore distributed fairness and independent state validation.
