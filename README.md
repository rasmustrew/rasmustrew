# Rasmus Thorsøe

Software engineer with a background in systems development and hands-on experience building rendering systems.

I’m interested in rendering architecture, performance, and how low-level implementation details shape behaviour on both CPU and GPU.

## Projects

**cpp-opengl-rendering**  
A C++ OpenGL renderer with reusable buffer and shader abstractions, camera transforms, and runtime debug views (normals, depth, lighting).

**rust-wgpu-rendering**  
An earlier renderer experiment using Rust and wgpu, exploring explicit command encoding and GPU resource ownership models inspired by Vulkan-style APIs.

**P2P Uno – Anti-Cheat**  
A peer-to-peer terminal-based Uno implementation with a protocol designed to detect rule violations without a trusted authority. The project included performance benchmarks.
